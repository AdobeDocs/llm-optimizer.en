## What is Adobe LLM Optimizer?

Adobe LLM Optimizer is a generative AI-first application for Generative Engine Optimization (also called Answer Engine Optimization), designed to help brands enhance their visibility, accuracy, and influence in AI-driven search environments. It provides insights into brand presence in AI-generated answers, offers prescriptive content recommendations, and automates optimization fixes.

## What are LLM Optimizer Capabilities?

Adobe LLM Optimizer offers a suite of tools designed for generative engine optimization:

* Measure Brand Visibility: Track when, where, and how often your brand appears in AI-powered search results, with a clear visibility score for benchmarking.
* Benchmark Competitors: Compare your brand's share of voice and presence against competitors in generative engines.
* Discover Actionable Opportunities: Identify content and technical improvements (like FAQs, abstracts, schema, crawlability) to boost mentions and citations.
* Track Traffic Impact: Monitor both agentic (AI assistant) and referral traffic to your owned properties, linking visibility to engagement.
* Enable Team Collaboration: Share dashboards, assign owners, and align goals across marketing, SEO, and communications teams.


<!-- I'm adding headings because LLMs like them and that way we'll rank better. Generally question format/question words in the the title is preferred. We can discuss. Or we can mirror what we did for Sites Optimizer and have this info on another page-->

* AI-generated answers are reshaping consumer discovery.
* LLM Optimizer ensures your brand is visible, accurate, and influential in these environments.
* It connects AI visibility to real business outcomes like engagement and revenue.
* In a world of zero-click journeys, this tool is essential for staying competitive.

* **Marketing Managers** measure brand visibility and campaign effectiveness in AI search.
