## What is Adobe LLM Optimizer?

Adobe LLM Optimizer is a generative AI-first application for Generative Engine Optimization (also called Answer Engine Optimization), designed to help brands enhance their visibility, accuracy, and influence in AI-driven search environments. It provides insights into brand presence in AI-generated answers, offers prescriptive content recommendations, and automates optimization fixes.

<!-- I'm adding headings because LLMs like them and that way we'll rank better. Generally question format/ question words in the the title is preferred. But we can discuss. Or we can mirror what we did for Sites Optimizer and have this info on another page-->

## Why LLM optimization matters for your brand

* AI-generated answers are reshaping consumer discovery.
* LLM Optimizer ensures your brand is visible, accurate, and influential in these environments.
* It connects AI visibility to real business outcomes like engagement and revenue.
* In a world of zero-click journeys, this tool is essential for staying competitive.

## Who should use Adobe LLM Optimizer?

Generative Engine Optimization is cross-functional by nature. LLM Optimizer is designed with this lens for the different personas listed below:

* **Marketing Managers** → measure brand visibility and campaign effectiveness in AI search.
* **SEO Analysts** → track brand mentions, citations, and other insights to inform content strategy.
* **PR & Communications Managers** → track brand perception in LLMs by 3rd-party platforms and address misinformation, manage sentiments, and protect brand trust.

<!-- A "guide" for each persona - those will live on separate pages - not sure if I can complete by GA -->

## What can I do with Adobe LLM Optimizer?

As such, with Adobe LLM Optimizer, you can:

**Measure Brand Visibility** - track when, where, and how often your brand is mentioned in AI-powered search results. Move beyond guesswork with a clear visibility score you can benchmark over time.
**Benchmark Competitors** - See how your brand stacks up against competitors in generative engines. Identify share of voice gaps and uncover competitive advantages.
**Discover Actionable Opportunities** - Pinpoint content opportunities (e.g., FAQs, abstracts, schema) and technical opportunities (crawlability, indexing issues) that directly increase mentions and citations.
**Track Traffic Impact from AI** - Monitor agentic traffic (from AI assistants) and referral traffic (user clicks from citations) to your owned properties. Tie GEO visibility to real engagement.
**Enable Team Collaboration** - Share dashboards, assign owners for prompts or categories, and ensure visibility goals are tracked across marketing, SEO, and communications functions.
