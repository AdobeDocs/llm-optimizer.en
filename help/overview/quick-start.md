### Step 1: Onboard your domain

### Step 2: Automatic Pre-population of Insights

Once your domain is onboarded, LLM Optimizer will automatically pre-populate the following:

**Categories** - broad content areas relevant to your domain
**Topics** - specific themes tied to high volume non-branded keywords associated with your domain
**Prompts** - Queries (branded and non-branded) to provide a baseline visibility

This ensures that even before you add your custom configurations/inputs, you will see initial insights into your brand visibility.

### Step 3: Customize Categories, Topics, and Prompts

* Add new categories that align with your business priorities.
* Enter custom topics or subtopics you want tracked.
* Create your prompts to monitor visibility in specific queries.
* Define mention aliases so all mentions are captured.
* Define competitor aliases to track competitors accurately.

### Step 4: Provide information for CDN Log Forwarding

To unlock Agentic Traffic and Referral Traffic insights, provide information for CDN log forwarding.
