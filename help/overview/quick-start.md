## Onboarding overview

TBD

### Step 1: Onboard your domain

**Add info for AEM and Non-AEM customers.TBD**

### Step 2: Automatic Pre-population of Insights

Once your domain is onboarded, LLM Optimizer will automatically populate the following:

**Categories** - Broad content areas relevant to your domain.
**Topics** - Specific themes tied to high volume non-branded keywords associated with your domain.
**Prompts** - Queries (branded and non-branded) to provide baseline visibility.

This ensures that even before you add your custom configurations/inputs, you will see initial insights into your brand visibility.

### Step 3: Customize Categories, Topics, and Prompts

* Add new categories that align with your business priorities.
* Enter custom topics or subtopics that need to be tracked.
* Create your prompts to monitor visibility in specific queries.
* Define mention aliases so all mentions are captured.
* Define competitor aliases to track competitors accurately.

### Step 4: Provide information for CDN Log Forwarding

To unlock Agentic Traffic and Referral Traffic insights, provide information for CDN log forwarding. See each specific page for more information:

* [Agentic Traffic](/help/dashboards/agentic-traffic.md)
* [Referral Traffic](/help/dashboards/referral-traffic.md)

### Step 5: Explore Dashboards & Take Action

After you provide information for CDN Log Forwarding, you can:

* View the [Brand Presence](/help/dashboards/brand-presence.md) dashboard, view your visibility score and track your performance relative to your competitors.
* Explore the [Agentic](/help/dashboards/agentic-traffic.md) and [Referral Traffic](/help/dashboards/referral-traffic.md) dashboards.
* Use [Opportunities](/help/dashboards/opportunities.md) to identify content and technical improvements.
* Export data and collaborate your team or invite your co-worker to use the product.
