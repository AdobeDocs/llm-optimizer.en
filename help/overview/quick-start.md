# Quick Start

To get started with LLM optimizer, you need to go through the onboarding process. After that you will have full access to LLM Optimizer's dashboards and full functionalities.

## Onboarding overview

The onboarding process starts with onboarding your domain. The process is different depending on whether you are an AEM Cloud Customer or not. After you complete the process, you will need to provide information for CDN Log Forwarding and finally customize categories, topics, and prompts.

### Step 1: Onboard your domain

### AEM Cloud Customers

AEM Cloud Customers (Cloud Service/Managed Services/ Edge Delivery Service), will see the option to try LLM Optimizer via the Product Announcement card in [Experience Hub](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/experience-hub/experience-hub).

>[!NOTE]
>Newly added prompts will not appear in Brand Presence until processing is complete. AEM Cloud Customers (Cloud Service, Managed Services/ Edge Delivery Service) can use the free trial version of LLM Optimizer. Use of more than 200 prompts requires a separate license agreement. Access is provided on an “as-is” and “as-available” basis, and may be modified, limited or removed by Adobe at any time. Please reach out to your [account representative] for more information.

Once you click the **Try LLM Optimizer** button, you will be redirected to [https://llmo.now](https://llmo.now) . You will then be required to log in via IMS. Once you log in you will start the onboarding process by providing a domain and the brand name.

>[!NOTE]
>The domain you provided will be used by everyone your organization and cannot be changed.

To trigger the Brand Presence Analysis, you will need to provide categories, topics, and prompts.

Additionally, you also need to configure CDN log forwarding for traffic analysis. LLM Optimizer requires Brand Presence data and insights from agentic and referral traffic to identify opportunities and to provide prescriptive recommendations to help customers boost their AI-visibility.

### Non-AEM Cloud Customers

After you sign the contract, you will be onboarded via slackbot command with the domain you would like to onboard on LLM Optimizer. Once this onboarding is complete, you will be able to log in to LLM Optimizer via [https://llmo.now](https://llmo.now) . 

### Step 2: Automatic Pre-population of Insights

Once your domain is onboarded, LLM Optimizer will automatically populate the following:

* **Categories** - Broad content areas relevant to your domain.
* **Topics** - Specific themes tied to high volume non-branded keywords associated with your domain.
* **Prompts** - Queries (branded and non-branded) to provide baseline visibility.

This ensures that even before you add your custom configurations and inputs, you will see initial insights into your brand visibility.

### Step 3: Customize Categories, Topics, and Prompts

Click on the [customer configuration dashboard](/help/dashboards/customer-configuration.md) to start customizing your Categories, Topics, and Prompts.

From this dashboard, you can:

* Add new categories that align with your business priorities.
* Enter custom topics or subtopics that need to be tracked.
* Create your prompts to monitor visibility in specific queries.
* Define mention aliases so all mentions are captured.
* Define competitor aliases to track competitors accurately.

### Step 4: Provide information for CDN Log Forwarding

To unlock Agentic Traffic and Referral Traffic insights, you need to provide information for CDN log forwarding. See each specific page for more details on how to configure log forwarding:

* [Agentic Traffic](/help/dashboards/agentic-traffic.md)
* [Referral Traffic](/help/dashboards/referral-traffic.md#setup#cdn-setup)

### Step 5: Explore Dashboards and Take Action

After you provide information for CDN Log Forwarding, you can:

* View the [Brand Presence](/help/dashboards/brand-presence.md) dashboard, view your visibility score and track your performance relative to your competitors.
* Explore the [Agentic](/help/dashboards/agentic-traffic.md) and [Referral Traffic](/help/dashboards/referral-traffic.md) dashboards.
* Use [Opportunities](/help/dashboards/opportunities.md) to identify content and technical improvements.
* Export data and collaborate your team or invite your co-worker to use the product.
