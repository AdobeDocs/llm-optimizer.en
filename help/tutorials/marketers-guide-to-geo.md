# Marketer's guide to Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)

Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), also called Answer Engine Optimization (AEO), is how you make your brand and content visible, trustworthy, and retrievable within AI-generated answers - across ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, Perplexity, and other LLM-driven assistants. ChatGPT owns the majority of the traffic - google is in Gemini?

If traditional SEO helped you win page-one rankings, GEO helps you win AI citations and visibility inside answer engines.

## How GEO is changing your world

May remove this - Traditional SEO focuses on rankings in Google SERPs and GEO shifts focus to visibility within AI-generated answers and citation frequency.
You must now think about semantic visibility and retrieval relevance - not just keyword rankings.

## SEO analyst's guide to Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)/Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)

As an SEO professional/analyst, your goal is to maximize discoverability and inclusion of brand content within generative AI responses - ensuring that optimized pages are surfaced, cited, and drive measurable traffic or engagement.

### SEO analyst's new mission

You're evolving from optimizing for search engine algorithms to optimizing for language model retrieval.
Your success now depends on how well your content is understood, trusted, and surfaced by generative systems.

Where you once asked, "What's my rank for this keyword?",
you now ask, "Is my content being cited in AI answers?"

Or something like this

As an SEO Analyst, your job used to be about rankings, top 10 positions, SERP snippets, keyword share. Now, with generative AI systems answering user questions directly, visibility is shifting.
I'm not just optimizing for search engines anymore, I'm optimizing for answer engines.

Generative Engine Optimization means ensuring our content is retrievable, relevant, and trustworthy enough to be pulled into AI-generated responses on tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Gemini. My success depends on how often these systems find, use, and cite our content when people ask questions about our brand, products, or expertise area

### What You Need from a GEO Tool (like Profound or Adobe LLM Optimizer)

AI Visibility Tracking: You need to see when and how your pages are appearing in AI-generated answers.

Query-to-Answer Mapping: You want insight into the prompts and intents that lead AI to use your content.

Content Retrievability Scoring: You need to know if your content structure, schema, and semantics make it easily "understood" by LLMs.

Competitor AI Benchmarking: You want to see which competitors dominate AI answers and where they're gaining visibility.

Snippet Attribution Analysis: You want to track the exact phrasing or paragraphs AIs are pulling from your site.

Agentic Traffic Measurement: You need to understand traffic coming from AI-driven referrals or summaries.

Adobe Analytics Integration: You want these GEO signals integrated with existing dashboards and KPIs.

### Why this matters to you

You can prove your value in a post-keyword world by measuring "AI share of voice."

You can future-proof your strategy as users move from search results to AI answers.

You can bridge SEO and brand by structuring content that's not only findable, but also quotable.

### Your GEO KPIs

AI Share of Voice (visibility in AI answers)

Brand Citation Frequency

Content Retrievability Score

AI-driven Clicks or Mentions

Structured Data Coverage

You're moving from ranking higher to being retrieved more often.
