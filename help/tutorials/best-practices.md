# Best Practices

[DRAFT]

LLM Optimization, also called Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), or Answer Engine Optimization (AEO), or AI Optimization (AIO), is how you make your brand and content visible, trustworthy, and retrievable within AI-generated answers - across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Copilot, Gemini, and other LLM-driven assistants.

If traditional SEO helped you win page-one rankings, LLM optimization helps you win AI citations and visibility inside answer engines. The Adobe LLM Optimizer lets you measure and improve your brand's visibility inside answer engines.

This article describes best practices around measuring and enhancing your visibility and influence in AI-driven search environments using the Adobe LLM Optimizer.

## Unlocking LLM Brand Visibility

Large Language Model (LLM) optimization is transforming how brands are discovered and referenced in AI-driven environments. Adobe's LLM Optimizer provides a structured approach to enhance brand visibility.

Follow these steps to improve your LLM visibility:

1. **Analyze:** Review how your brand appears in key customer prompts across LLMs.
2. **Plan:** Target clusters of prompts with similar intent for focused campaigns.
3. **Act:** Implement changes and monitor shifts in LLM visibility over time.
4. **Adapt:** Refine strategies based on actionable insights from the optimizer.

Understanding and leveraging these steps can help your brand stay relevant as AI becomes central to information discovery.

## LLM vs SEO: Key Differences

A good LLM strategy builds on top of a good SEO strategy. An SEO strategy is foundational to any LLM optimizations. Currently SEO traffic still is the largest driver of traffic to most web sites making it very important to your brand's visibility strategy.

It's important to understand that optimizing for LLMs differs from traditional SEO because of some key differences:

* LLMs use tokens, not indexes: Results are generated from trained data, not indexed web pages, but LLMs do use search engines to enhance prompt answers via Retrievel-Augmented Generation (RAG).
* Real-time info via RAG: Search engines use real-time data while RAG allows LLMs to fetch up-to-date information, reducing hallucinations.
* Limited client-side JS rendering: LLMs currently do not process client-side JavaScript, affecting what content is visible.

Because of some of these fundamental differences, with LLM strategy you need to consider the following:

* Brand mentions matter more than link for LLMs: LLMs prioritize content relevance and brand presence over backlinks. Unlike SEO, LLMs do not use links to determine authority.
* Freshness of content matters: LLMs prioritize recently updated content. (Search engines also prioritize this for time-sensitive queries but rely on other values more heavily.)
* Getting earned (third-party) in the form of mentions and citations is very important.

## Strategic Campaign Planning

Building a successful LLM optimization campaign involves:

Identify high-value topics: Align prompt intent with business goals and customer needs.
Spot competitor mentions: Focus on prompts where competitors are cited, indicating opportunity for brand inclusion.
Group prompts by intent: Use topics and search fields to cluster similar user goals for benchmarking visibility.
Assess realistic brand inclusion: Evaluate if your brand can be credibly mentioned, considering factors like EEAT (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) and YMYL (Your Money or Your Life) standards.

This strategic approach ensures targeted, data-driven improvements in LLM visibility.


## Actionable Optimization Steps

The LLM Optimizer suggests optimization opportunities in the [Opportunities](/help/dashboards/opportunities.md) dashboard.

Here are some practical actions to consider to boost brand visibility in LLMs:

* Update Wikipedia pages: Ensure company and cited pages are current and relevant.
* Enable LLM access: Monitor robots.txt and CDN settings to prevent blocking AI bots.
* Revamp content: Refresh 10-15% of page content, add references, and improve structure with headers (H1, H2, H3).
* Add FAQs: Integrate relevant FAQs based on prompt analysis to address user queries.
* Increase brand mentions on Reddit/Quora: Contribute to user-generated content platforms where LLMs source citations. Be careful of how you approach this as you can trigger

Consistent execution of these steps can significantly enhance your brand's presence in AI-driven search results.



## What is LLM visibility?

LLM visibility is all about how often and how well your brand shows up in answers generated by tools like ChatGPT or other AI models.

## How to measure your LLM progress

To benchmark your website's visibility and to see how well your efforts are working, track these key metrics:

* **Mentions:** How many times your brand is mentioned in responses.
* **Citations:** How often LLMs use your content or sources to answer questions.
* **Sentiment:** Whether the mention of your brand is positive, neutral, or negative.
* **Position:** Where your brand is mentioned in the response (e.g., first, middle, or last).

All of these factors combine into a **visibility** score, which tells you how strong your brand's presence is in LLM responses.

## How to Track Visibility Changes

Here's how you can keep an eye on your brand's visibility in LLMs:

1. Check Your Current Visibility
    * Adobe LLM Optimizer shows you how often your brand is mentioned and cited and what the sentiment is in LLM responses. See the Brand Presence dashboard.
    * Look at the prompts (questions) where your brand is mentioned and where it's missing.
    * Compare your visibility to your competitors to see how you stack up.
    * Check how you are showing up in user-generated platforms like Reddit, Quora, and Wikipedia as these are often cited by LLMs to find information.
    * Check how you are showing up in agentic traffic. Agentic traffic often does not go to the home page - it's worth looking at what pages agents visit.
    * Make sure your content is visible and accessible to LLMs. You can use the Chrome plug-in to see what AI agents can view.

1.  Plan Your Strategy
    * Group similar prompts together based on what people are asking.
    * Focus on the prompts that are most important to your customers.
    * Check if your brand has a good chance of being mentioned for certain prompts.
    * Make sure your content shows your expertise, trustworthiness, and authority (EEAT).

1. Improve Your Content
    * Use the LLM Optimizer Opportunities to identify and make specifically recommended, immediate changes to your site. See [Opportunities](/help/dashboards/opportunities.md) (then measure the results.) Review the opportunities section regularly and take action on the recommendations provided.
    * Update your website and other content to make it more relevant to the prompts you want to target.
    * Add FAQs to your pages that answer common questions people might ask.
    * Make sure your content is easy for LLMs to find and read. Fix any issues like blocked pages or problems with your website's code.
    * Ensure contributions to platforms like Wikipedia and Reddit are unbiased, non-commercial, and add value.
    * Use Adobe LLM Optimizer to track how your visibility changes over time.
    * If you notice competitors getting mentioned more often, adjust your strategy to stay ahead.
    * Keep updating your content to match what people are searching for and asking about.


<!-- Use the "Share of Voice" feature to see which competitors are dominating specific topics and adjust your strategy accordingly.-->

<!-- Purpose: Measure how much of the conversation your brand owns compared to competitors.
Insight:

This feature shows the percentage of visibility your brand has for specific topics compared to competitors.

Use this insight to identify gaps in your visibility and focus on improving your presence in under-performing topics.-->

<!--6. Content Visibility

Purpose: Ensure LLMs can access and render your content.
Insight:

The dashboard compares what LLMs can see versus what is actually on your page.
It provides a percentage of content visibility, highlighting areas where LLMs may only see a small portion of your page due to client-side rendering issues.


Best Practice:

Use nametbd feature to render static HTML versions of your pages for LLM bots, ensuring full content visibility.
Address issues like blocked pages, robots.txt restrictions, and client-side rendering problems.-->
