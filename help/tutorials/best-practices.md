# LLM Optimizer best practices

LLM Optimization, also called Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), or Answer Engine Optimization (AEO), or AI Optimization (AIO), is how you make your brand and content visible, trustworthy, and retrievable within AI-generated answers - across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Copilot, Gemini, and other LLM-driven assistants.

If traditional SEO helped you win page-one rankings, LLM optimization helps you win AI citations and visibility inside answer engines. The Adobe LLM Optimizer lets you measure and improve your brand's visibility inside answer engines.

This article describes best practices around measuring and enhancing your visibility and influence in AI-driven search environments using Adobe LLM Optimizer.

## LLM vs SEO: Key differences {#key-differences}

A strong SEO foundation supports LLM optimization, but new tactics are needed to ensure visibility in AI-generated responses.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Currently SEO traffic is still the largest driver of traffic to most web sites making it very important to your brand's visibility strategy.


|SEO | LLM |
|---------|----------|
| Index-based | *Token-based (trained data)|
| Link authority matters | **Brand mentions matter more |
| JS-rendering supported | Very limited client-side JS rendering |
| Real-time indexing | ***Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for freshness |

*Although LLM results do not use indexed pages,  LLMs do use search engines to enhance prompt answers via Retrievel-Augmented Generation (RAG).

** LLMs prioritize content relevance and brand presence over backlinks.

*** RAG reduces hallucinations

Other considerations for LLM optimization:

* Freshness of content matters: LLMs prioritize recently updated content. (Search engines also prioritize this for time-sensitive queries but rely on other values more heavily.)
* Getting earned (third-party) in the form of mentions and citations is very important.

## Unlocking LLM Brand Visibility

LLM visibility is all about how often and how prominently your brand shows up in AI-generated answers.

To improve your visibility,

1. **Analyze:** Review how your brand appears in key customer prompts across LLMs.
2. **Plan:** Target clusters of prompts with similar intent for focused campaigns.
3. **Act:** Implement changes and monitor shifts in LLM visibility over time.
4. **Adapt:** Refine strategies based on actionable insights from the optimizer.

Understanding and leveraging these steps can help your brand stay relevant as AI becomes central to information discovery.

## Strategic campaign planning

Building a successful LLM optimization campaign involves:

* Identify high-value topics: Align prompt intent with business goals and customer needs.
* Spot competitor mentions: Focus on prompts where competitors are cited, indicating opportunity for brand inclusion.
* Group prompts by intent: Use topics and search fields to cluster similar user goals for benchmarking visibility.
* Assess realistic brand inclusion: Evaluate if your brand can be credibly mentioned, considering factors like EEAT (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) and YMYL (Your Money or Your Life) standards.

This strategic approach ensures targeted, data-driven improvements in LLM visibility.

## Actionable optimization steps

The LLM Optimizer suggests optimization opportunities in the [Opportunities](/help/dashboards/opportunities.md) dashboard.

Here are some practical actions to consider to boost brand visibility in LLMs:

* Update Wikipedia pages: Ensure company and cited pages are current and relevant.
* Enable LLM access: Monitor robots.txt and CDN settings to prevent blocking AI bots.
* Revamp content: Refresh 10-15% of page content, add references, and improve structure with headers (H1, H2, H3).
* Add FAQs: Integrate relevant FAQs based on prompt analysis to address user queries.
* Increase brand mentions on Reddit/Quora: Contribute to user-generated content platforms where LLMs source citations. Be careful of how you approach this as you can trigger

Consistent execution of these steps can significantly enhance your brand's presence in AI-driven search results.

## Offsite optimization for LLM visibility

Offsite optimization focuses on improving your brand's visibility in AI-generated answers by influencing third-party content sources that LLMs frequently cite.

Key Offsite Channels:

* Wikipedia: Ensure pages are up-to-date, well-sourced, and neutrally written.
* Reddit & Quora: Participate in discussions with authentic, helpful contributions.
* Affiliate Articles & Reviews: Collaborate with publishers for high-quality content.
* YouTube & Social Media: Create videos and posts that answer common questions.
* News & PR: Secure coverage in reputable outlets.

Best Practices:

* Diversify your offsite footprint.
* Monitor citations using Adobe's LLM Optimizer.
* Update stale content and seek new inclusion opportunities.
* Coordinate with PR and social teams.
* Ensure contributions are unbiased and informative.

## Measuring LLM visibility

To benchmark your website's visibility or to see visibility improvements, track these key metrics:

* **Mentions:** How many times your brand is mentioned in responses.
* **Citations:** How often LLMs use your content or sources to answer questions.
* **Sentiment:** Whether the mention of your brand is positive, neutral, or negative.
* **Position:** Where your brand is mentioned in the response (e.g., first, middle, or last).

These metrics combine into a **visibility** score, which tells you how strong your brand's presence is in LLM responses. See the [Brand Presence](/help/dashboards/brand-presence.md) board.

## Tracking visibility changes

Here are steps you can follow to monitor progress:

1. Check Your Current Visibility
    * Use Adobe LLM Optimizer to show you how often your brand is mentioned and cited and what the sentiment is in LLM responses. See the [Brand Presence](/help/dashboards/brand-presence.md) dashboard.
    * Analyze prompts where your brand appears and where it doesn't.
    * Benchmark against competitors.
    * Review visibility on user-generated platforms like Reddit, Quora, and Wikipedia. These UGC platforms are often cited by LLMs to find information.
    * Monitor agentic traffic to understand which pages LLMs visit. Agentic traffic often does **not** go to the home page but other pages lower in the hierarchy. See the [Agentic Traffic](/help/assets/overview/agentic-traffic-card.png) dashboard.
    * Make sure your content is visible and accessible to LLMs. You can use the Chrome plug-in to see what AI agents can view.

1.  Plan Your Strategy
    * Group similar prompts together based on what people are asking.
    * Focus on the prompts that are most important to your customers.
    * Check if your brand has a good chance of being mentioned for certain prompts.
    * Make sure your content shows your expertise, trustworthiness, and authority (EEAT).

1. Improve Your Content
    * Use the LLM Optimizer Opportunities to identify and make specifically recommended, immediate changes to your site. See [Opportunities](/help/dashboards/opportunities.md) (then measure the results.) Review the opportunities section regularly and take action on the recommendations provided.
    * Update your website and other content to make it more relevant to the prompts you want to target.
    * Add FAQs to your pages that answer common questions people might ask.
    * Make sure your content is easy for LLMs to find and read. Fix any issues like blocked pages or problems with your website's code.
    * Ensure contributions to platforms like Wikipedia and Reddit are unbiased, non-commercial, and add value.
    * Use Adobe LLM Optimizer to track how your visibility changes over time.
    * If you notice competitors getting mentioned more often, adjust your strategy to stay ahead.
    * Keep updating your content to match what people are searching for and asking about.

## Understanding Agentic Traffic

Agentic traffic refers to visits from AI agents like ChatGPT, Google's AI mode/overviews, Copilot, or Perplexity. These agents crawl your site to gather information for generating answers.

Agentic traffic shows up in two ways: zero-click experiences and visibility without clicks.

### Zero-Click Experiences

In traditional search, users click through to websites to consume content. But with LLMs users often get complete answers directly in the chat interface or serach engine results pate without ever visiting your site. This is called a zero-click experience.

What this means for your brand:

1. Your content might be summarized or cited by an AI assistant.
2. The user gets the information they need without clicking on your link.
3. Your site's visibility and influence are decoupled from traffic.

So, even if your analytics show fewer visits, your brand could still be highly visible and influential in AI-generated answers.

### Visibility without clicks

Agentic traffic refers to AI bots visiting your site to gather information for training or answering prompts.

These bots do the following:

1. Crawl your pages to extract facts, structure, and context.
2. Use that data to generate answers for users.
3. May cite your brand or content - even if no human ever clicks through.

Why this matters:

* Your content can shape user decisions indirectly.
* You may be influencing purchase behavior, brand perception, or trust without traditional engagement metrics.

Tracking agentic traffic helps you understand how AI sees and uses your content.

### How to Optimize for Agentic Traffic:

To optimize for agentic traffic:

* Ensure crawlability by reviewing robots.txt and CDN settings.
* Use the [URL Inspector ](/help/dashboards/url-inspector.md)to analyze URL performance.
* Track bot behavior by accessing your CDN logs in the [Agentic traffic dashboard](/help/dashboards/agentic-traffic.md).
* Segment traffic to understand business outcomes. See [Best practices for categories, topics, prompts, and competitors](/help/overview/best-practices-topics-prompts.md).

Here are the metrics to monitor:

* Agent hits per URL
* Success rate of bot requests
* Citation frequency per page
* Sentiment and placement of brand mentions
* Visibility score trends over time
