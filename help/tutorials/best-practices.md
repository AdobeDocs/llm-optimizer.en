# Best Practices

## Unlocking LLM Brand Visibility

Large Language Model (LLM) optimization is transforming how brands are discovered and referenced in AI-driven environments. Adobe's LLM Optimizer provides a structured approach to enhance brand visibility.

If you follow these steps, you are well on your way to improve your LLM visibility:

1. Analysis: Review how your brand appears in key customer prompts across LLMs.
2. Planning: Target clusters of prompts with similar intent for focused campaigns.
3. Action: Implement changes and monitor shifts in LLM visibility over time.
4. Adaptation: Refine strategies based on actionable insights from the optimizer.
5. Understanding and leveraging these steps can help brands stay relevant as AI becomes central to information discovery.



## LLM vs SEO: Key Differences

Optimizing for LLMs differs fundamentally from traditional SEO:

* LLMs use tokens, not indexes: Results are generated from trained data, not indexed web pages.
* Brand mentions matter more than links: LLMs prioritize content relevance and brand presence over backlinks.
* Real-time info via RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation allows LLMs to fetch up-to-date information, reducing hallucinations.
* Limited client-side JS rendering: LLMs currently do not process client-side JavaScript, affecting what content is visible.
* No link authority attribution: Unlike SEO, LLMs do not use links to determine authority.
* Recognizing these differences is crucial for effective LLM optimization.



## Actionable Optimization Steps

The LLM Optimizer suggests optimization opportunities in the Opportunities dashboard.

Here are some practical actions to boost brand visibility in LLMs:

* Update Wikipedia pages: Ensure company and cited pages are current and relevant.
* Enable LLM access: Monitor robots.txt and CDN settings to prevent blocking AI bots.
* Revamp content: Refresh 10-15% of page content, add references, and improve structure with headers (H1, H2, H3).
* Add FAQs: Integrate relevant FAQs based on prompt analysis to address user queries.
* Increase brand mentions on Reddit/Quora: Contribute to user-generated content platforms where LLMs source citations.

Consistent execution of these steps can significantly enhance your brand's presence in AI-driven search results.





# Marketer's guide to Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)

Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), also called Answer Engine Optimization (AEO), is how you make your brand and content visible, trustworthy, and retrievable within AI-generated answers - across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Copilot, Gemini, and other LLM-driven assistants.

If traditional SEO helped you win page-one rankings, GEO helps you win AI citations and visibility inside answer engines. The Adobe LLM Optimizer lets you measure how your brand and content is visible inside those answer engines.

This article describes how to measure and enhance your visibility and influence in AI-driven search environments whether you're an SEO analyst/specialist, public relations (PR) or communication strategist, or a marketing manager.

<!-- ## How GEO is changing your world

May remove this - Traditional SEO focuses on rankings in Google SERPs and GEO shifts focus to visibility within AI-generated answers and citation frequency.

Think about semantic visibility and retrieval relevance - not just keyword rankings. -->

## SEO analyst's guide to Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)/Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)

As an SEO professional/analyst, your goal is to maximize discoverability and inclusion of brand content within generative AI responses. You're ensuring that optimized pages are surfaced, cited, and drive measurable traffic or engagement.

Your focus is on rankings, top 10 positions, search engine results page (SERP) results, and keyword share. Now, with generative AI systems answering user questions directly, visibility is shifting and you need to look at some additional metrics. You're not only looking at your site **ranking higher** but at your content **being retrieved more often**.

### Top KPIs for SEO analysts

In Adobe's LLM Optimizer, top KPIs are available directly in the tool.

<!-- * AI Visibility Tracking: You need to see when and how your pages are appearing in AI-generated answers. This includes **citations** and **mentions** and sentiment. See [Brand Presence dashboard](/help/dashboards/brand-presence.md)

* Agentic Traffic Measurement: You need to understand traffic coming from AI-driven referrals or summaries. See [Agentic Traffic dashboard](/help/dashboards/agentic-traffic.md)-->

<!-- Not sure llm optimizer has all these - remove those not relevant-->

Query-to-Answer Mapping: You want insight into the prompts and intents that lead AI to use your content.

Content Retrievability Scoring: You need to know if your content structure, schema, and semantics make it easily "understood" by LLMs.

Competitor AI Benchmarking: You want to see which competitors dominate AI answers and where they're gaining visibility.

Snippet Attribution Analysis: You want to track the exact phrasing or paragraphs AIs are pulling from your site.

## PR and Communication manager's guide to Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)/Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)

As a PR and Communications manager, your goal is to control media coverage and to manage not only what journalists are saying but what AI systems say. When someone asks an AI bot about your brand, product, or CEO, the model is to synthesize data from across the web, including press releases, Wikipedia, reviews, and third-party mentions.

Your focus is on shaping and protecting your brand narrative in this new AI ecosystem.

What You Need from a GEO Tool

* AI Brand Monitoring: You need visibility into how your brand, executives, and products are described by major AI systems.
* Sentiment and Tone Tracking: You want to assess whether AI responses reflect your desired voice and emotional tone.
* Source Influence Mapping: You need to know which media, review sites, and third-party pages are most influential in shaping AI output.
* Narrative Accuracy Scoring: You want to verify factual accuracy and detect outdated or incorrect data.
* Crisis Detection Alerts: You want immediate notifications when an AI model spreads a misrepresentation.
* Content Validation Tools: You want to feed the right, structured, authoritative data into the ecosystem (via schema, Wikipedia, and knowledge graphs).

Your Focus Areas

Brand Narrative Audit    Check how AI describes your brand    Ensures accuracy and consistency
Influence Mapping    Identify which sources shape AI answers    Prioritizes outreach and corrections
