## Unlocking LLM Brand Visibility

Large Language Model (LLM) optimization is transforming how brands are discovered and referenced in AI-driven environments. Adobe's LLM Optimizer provides a structured approach to enhance brand visibility.

If you follow these steps, you are well on your way to improve your LLM visibility:

1. Analysis: Review how your brand appears in key customer prompts across LLMs.
2. Planning: Target clusters of prompts with similar intent for focused campaigns.
3. Action: Implement changes and monitor shifts in LLM visibility over time.
4. Adaptation: Refine strategies based on actionable insights from the optimizer.
5. Understanding and leveraging these steps can help brands stay relevant as AI becomes central to information discovery.



## LLM vs SEO: Key Differences

Optimizing for LLMs differs fundamentally from traditional SEO:

* LLMs use tokens, not indexes: Results are generated from trained data, not indexed web pages.
* Brand mentions matter more than links: LLMs prioritize content relevance and brand presence over backlinks.
* Real-time info via RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation allows LLMs to fetch up-to-date information, reducing hallucinations.
* Limited client-side JS rendering: LLMs currently do not process client-side JavaScript, affecting what content is visible.
* No link authority attribution: Unlike SEO, LLMs do not use links to determine authority.
* Recognizing these differences is crucial for effective LLM optimization.



## Actionable Optimization Steps

The LLM Optimizer suggests optimization opportunities in the Opportunities dashboard.

Here are some practical actions to boost brand visibility in LLMs:

* Update Wikipedia pages: Ensure company and cited pages are current and relevant.
* Enable LLM access: Monitor robots.txt and CDN settings to prevent blocking AI bots.
* Revamp content: Refresh 10-15% of page content, add references, and improve structure with headers (H1, H2, H3).
* Add FAQs: Integrate relevant FAQs based on prompt analysis to address user queries.
* Increase brand mentions on Reddit/Quora: Contribute to user-generated content platforms where LLMs source citations.

Consistent execution of these steps can significantly enhance your brand's presence in AI-driven search results.


## Strategic Campaign Planning

Building a successful LLM optimization campaign involves:

Identify high-value topics: Align prompt intent with business goals and customer needs.
Spot competitor mentions: Focus on prompts where competitors are cited, indicating opportunity for brand inclusion.
Group prompts by intent: Use topics and search fields to cluster similar user goals for benchmarking visibility.
Assess realistic brand inclusion: Evaluate if your brand can be credibly mentioned, considering factors like EEAT (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) and YMYL (Your Money or Your Life) standards.

This strategic approach ensures targeted, data-driven improvements in LLM visibility.


This report is designed to help you understand how your brand's visibility in Large Language Models (LLMs) changes over time. It will guide you through the steps to track, improve, and measure your brand's presence in LLM-generated responses.

1. What is LLM Visibility?
LLM visibility is all about how often and how well your brand shows up in answers generated by tools like ChatGPT or other AI models. It depends on:

Mentions: How many times your brand is mentioned in responses.
Citations: How often LLMs use your content or sources to answer questions.
Sentiment: Whether the mention of your brand is positive, neutral, or negative.
Position: Where your brand is mentioned in the response (e.g., first, middle, or last).

All of these factors combine into a visibility score, which tells you how strong your brand's presence is in LLM responses.

2. How to Track Visibility Changes
Here's how you can keep an eye on your brand's visibility in LLMs:
Step 1: Check Your Current Visibility

Use tools like Adobe LLM Optimizer to see how often your brand is mentioned in LLM responses.
Look at the prompts (questions) where your brand is mentioned and where it's missing.
Compare your visibility to your competitors to see how you stack up.

Step 2: Plan Your Strategy

Group similar prompts together based on what people are asking.
Focus on the prompts that are most important to your customers.
Check if your brand has a good chance of being mentioned for certain prompts. Make sure your content shows your expertise, trustworthiness, and authority.

Step 3: Improve Your Content

Update your website and other content to make it more relevant to the prompts you want to target.
Add FAQs to your pages that answer common questions people might ask.
Make sure your content is easy for LLMs to find and read. Fix any issues like blocked pages or problems with your website's code.

Step 4: Keep Improving

Use Adobe LLM Optimizer to track how your visibility changes over time.
If you notice competitors getting mentioned more often, adjust your strategy to stay ahead.
Keep updating your content to match what people are searching for and asking about.


3. Tools You Can Use
Here are some tools that can help you track and improve your visibility:

Adobe LLM Optimizer: This tool shows you how visible your brand is, what prompts you're mentioned in, and how you compare to competitors.
Google Search Console: Use this to find out what people are searching for and turn those searches into LLM prompts.
SEO Tools: Tools like Ahrefs or SEMrush can help you find keywords and questions people are asking online.
User-Generated Content Platforms: Platforms like Reddit, Quora, and Wikipedia are often used by LLMs to find information. Make sure your brand is visible there.


4. How to Measure Your Progress
To see how well your efforts are working, track these key metrics:

Mentions: How many times your brand is mentioned in LLM responses.
Citations: How often LLMs use your content or sources.
Sentiment: Are the mentions positive, neutral, or negative?
Position: Is your brand mentioned first, in the middle, or last in the response?
Visibility Score: This is a number that combines all the above metrics to show your overall visibility.


5. Real-Life Examples
Here are some examples of how you can improve your visibility:
Example 1: Fixing Website Issues
If LLMs can't access your website because of blocked pages or coding problems, they won't mention your brand. You can use Adobe LLM Optimizer to fix these issues and make sure your content is easy for LLMs to find.
Example 2: Updating Wikipedia
Since LLMs often use Wikipedia for information, make sure your company's page is accurate and up-to-date. You can also add your brand to other Wikipedia pages where it's relevant.
Example 3: Engaging on Reddit and Quora
LLMs use platforms like Reddit and Quora to find answers. You can join discussions and share helpful information about your brand to increase visibility.

6. Challenges You Might Face

Understanding Metrics: It can be tricky to figure out what visibility scores mean. Use tools like Adobe LLM Optimizer to get clear explanations.
Technical Problems: If your website has blocked pages or coding issues, LLMs might not be able to access your content.
Keeping Content Relevant: You'll need to make sure your content matches what people are asking about.

Make sure your website is easy for LLMs to access by fixing any technical issues.

## PR and Communication manager's guide to Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)/Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)

As a PR and Communications manager, your goal is to control media coverage and to manage not only what journalists are saying but what AI systems say. When someone asks an AI bot about your brand, product, or CEO, the model is to synthesize data from across the web, including press releases, Wikipedia, reviews, and third-party mentions.

Your focus is on shaping and protecting your brand narrative in this new AI ecosystem.

* Source Influence Mapping: You need to know which media, review sites, and third-party pages are most influential in shaping AI output.
* Narrative Accuracy Scoring: You want to verify factual accuracy and detect outdated or incorrect data.
* Crisis Detection Alerts: You want immediate notifications when an AI model spreads a misrepresentation.
* Content Validation Tools: You want to feed the right, structured, authoritative data into the ecosystem (via schema, Wikipedia, and knowledge graphs).
