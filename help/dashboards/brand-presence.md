## Filters

At the top of the page, apply filters to refine your view:

**Date Range** → select the time window (e.g., last 4 weeks).
**Category** → filter results by predefined or custom categories.
**Platform** → choose which AI engine to analyze (e.g., ChatGPT).
**Region** → filter by geography if available.

## Key Metrics

The dashboard highlights three core metrics:

Visibility Score → weighted score of your brand's visibility
Mentions → total number of brand mentions across sampled prompts.
Citations → number of times your site was referenced as a source.

Trend indicators show how these values are changing over time compared to the previous period.

Explore detailed results by topics and prompts. Each row includes:

Topic (e.g., Coffee Roasting Basics, Advanced Roasting & Tasting)
Popularity (High, Medium, Low)
Visibility Score for that topic
Mentions count
Sentiment (positive, neutral, negative)
Position (relative prominence in AI responses)
All Citations (all URLs cited in AI responses)
Owned Citations (brand's owned URLs cited in AI responses)

This table helps you identify where your brand is strong and where optimization is needed.

### Using the Data Insights Table

The Data Insights Table helps you move from metrics to actions by breaking down performance at the topic and prompt level.

Key ways to use the table:

Prioritize high-popularity topics with low visibility → focus optimization where audience demand is strong but your brand presence is weak.
Track sentiment shifts → spot topics where mentions are trending negative or neutral, and coordinate with PR/Comms to respond.
Compare citations vs owned citations → identify prompts where your brand is mentioned but competitors’ content is cited, signaling a content gap.
Evaluate position range → monitor whether your brand appears early in AI responses (positions 1–3) or later (6–10).

Use the Export option to share insights with your team or to include in executive reporting.
