# Brand Presence {#brand-presence}

The Brand Presence dashboard provides an overview of how your brand is perceived at the level of AI-generated responses. It shows where, how often, and in what context your brand is mentioned. You can use the dashboard to measure visibility, track citations, compare competitors, and explore sentiment trends. The dashboard is divided into several sections, each providing different insights. There are also customizable filters to help you refine the displayed data.

## Filters {#filters}

At the top of the page, you can apply filters to refine your view. The filters you choose will impact **all** the sections present on the dashboard. You can customize the following:

* **Date Range** - Select the time frame for the displayed data. For example, the last 4 weeks. You also have the option to customize the time period by selecting the **Custom Weeks** option.
* **Category** - Filter the displayed results by predefined categories. You can also add custom categories to this field (**SR**-how?).
* **Platform** - Choose which AI engine to analyze.
* **Region** - Filter the results by geography. Not all regions will be available at launch.

After you select the desired filter, click **Apply Filters** to apply the selection to the dashboard.

## Overview Metrics {#overview-metrics}

The dashboard highlights three very important metrics at the top of the page: visibility score, mentions and citations. The lower the count for these metrics the worse you brand is perceived, and you should act to improve your brand presence. like **SR - ADD optimization link here here**. Presented below is a short description of each metric and what it represents.

### Visibility Score {#visibility-score}

The visibility score is composed of factors like: mentions, citations, sentiment, and rank. Each factor has a certain "weight" attached to it that adds towards the final score. For example, mentions "weight more" because visibility only matters if your brand is cited.

### Mentions {#mentions}

This metric represents the total number of times your brand or your categories were mentioned across the sampled AI prompts. For example, you have the "Coffe B" brand,with the "Machines" and "Accessories" categories and this metric counts the total number of times these appear in the sampled AI answers.

### Citations {#citations}

This metric represents the number of times your site was referenced as a source.

Trend indicators for each key metric show how these values are changing over time compared to the previous period.

## Competitor Comparison {#competitor-comparison}

In the competitor comparison section you can select up to five competitors and compare their mentions and citations against your brand. This way, you can view and benchmark your performance relative to the competition.

The competitors are selected from the drop-down list and the charts are updated when you click **Apply Filters**. The charts display weekly mentions and weekly citations side by side. You can also hover the mouse along the chart to see the data evolution across the weekly time frame.

## Sentiment Trend Analysis {#sentiment-trend}

In the sentiment trend analysis section you can track how your brand is perceived in the sampled AI answers. The sentiment trend metric can be either positive, neutral or negative. For example, it can be positive if answers highlight product quality, or negative if they mention poor service. The trend chart shows the shifts in brand perception week over week. The section is populated only after your brand is mentioned.

## Data Insights and Share of Voice {#data-insights}

Rounding up the dashboard, we have two important tables: data insights and share of voice. The information presented in these tables will help you identify where your brand is strong and where optimization is needed.  By using the **data insights** table you can explore topics and user questions to assess and optimize content impact. The results are detailed by topics and prompts. Meanwhile, the **share of voice** table, compares your brand voice to other competitors across topics and helps you identify gaps and prioritize future topics.

Both tables have a search field for quick access to topics. Also, you can use the **Export** option to download the table .csv and share the insights with your team or include the table in executive reporting.

### Using the Data Insights Table {#using-data-insights}

The Data Insights Table helps you move from metrics to actions by breaking down performance at the topic and prompt level.

Key ways to use the table:

* Prioritize high-popularity topics with low visibility - focus optimization where audience demand is strong but your brand presence is weak.
* Track sentiment shifts - spot topics where mentions are trending negative or neutral, and coordinate your response.
* Compare citations versus owned citations - identify prompts where your brand is mentioned but competitor's content is cited, signaling a content gap.
* Evaluate position range - monitor whether your brand appears early in AI responses (positions 1–3) or further down (6–10).
