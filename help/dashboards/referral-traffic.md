# Referral Traffic

Referral Traffic shows how visitors arrive at your site from external platforms, AI citations, and referral links. It tracks and analyzes traffic sources, referral patterns, and conversion metrics from external websites and platforms. This will help you understand which sources, regions, and pages drive the most engaged traffic. Data is sourced from either the CDN logs or AEM Operational Telemetry **(add link)**. Both of these sources are privacy-preserving and do not capture personal user data.

There are also customizable filters to help you refine the displayed data.
