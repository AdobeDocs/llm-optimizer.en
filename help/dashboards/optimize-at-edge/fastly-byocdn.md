# Fastly (BYOCDN)

This configuration routes agentic traffic (requests from AI bots and LLM user agents) to the Edge Optimize backend service (`live.edgeoptimize.net`). Human visitors and SEO bots continue to be served from your origin as usual. To test the configuration, after the setup is complete, look for the header `x-edgeoptimize-request-id` in the response.

**Prerequisites**

Before setting up the Fastly VCL rules, ensure you have:

* Access to Fastly for your domain.
* Completed the LLM Optimizer onboarding process.
* Completed CDN log forwarding to LLM Optimizer.
* An Edge Optimize API key retrieved from the LLM Optimizer UI.

**Configuration**

Add the following three VCL snippets to your Fastly service. These snippets handle routing agentic requests to Edge Optimize, cache-key separation, and failover to your default origin.

**vcl_recv snippet**

```
unset req.http.x-edgeoptimize-url;
unset req.http.x-edgeoptimize-config;
unset req.http.x-edgeoptimize-api-key;

if (!req.http.x-edgeoptimize-request
    && req.http.user-agent ~ "(?i)(AdobeEdgeOptimize-AI|ChatGPT-User|GPTBot|OAI-SearchBot|PerplexityBot|Perplexity-User)") {
  set req.http.x-forwarded-host = req.http.host; # required for identifying the original host
  set req.http.x-edgeoptimize-url = req.url; # required for identifying the original url
  set req.http.x-edgeoptimize-config = "LLMCLIENT=TRUE;"; # required for cache key
  set req.http.x-edgeoptimize-api-key = "<YOUR API KEY>"; # required for identifying the client
  set req.backend = F_EDGE_OPTIMIZE;
}
```

**vcl_hash snippet**

```
if (req.http.x-edgeoptimize-config) {
  set req.hash += "edge-optimize";
  set req.hash += req.http.x-edgeoptimize-config;
}
```

**vcl_deliver snippet**

```
if (req.http.x-edgeoptimize-config && resp.status >= 400) {
  set req.http.x-edgeoptimize-request = "failover";
  set req.backend = F_Default_Origin;
  restart;
}

if (!req.http.x-edgeoptimize-config && req.http.x-edgeoptimize-request == "failover") {
  set resp.http.x-edgeoptimize-fo = "1";
}
```

**Failover**

The `vcl_deliver` snippet handles failover automatically. If Edge Optimize returns a `4XX` or `5XX` error, the request is restarted and routed back to your default origin so the end-user still receives a response. Failover responses include the `x-edgeoptimize-fo: 1` header.

| Scenario | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Edge Optimize returns `2XX` | Optimized response is served to the client. |
| Edge Optimize returns `4XX` or `5XX` | Request is restarted and served from the default origin. |
| Failover response | Includes the header `x-edgeoptimize-fo: 1`. |

**Verify the setup**

After completing the setup, verify that bot traffic is being routed to Edge Optimize and that human traffic remains unaffected.

**1. Test bot traffic (should be optimized)**

Simulate an AI bot request using an agentic user-agent:

```
curl -svo /dev/null https://www.example.com/page.html \
  --header "user-agent: chatgpt-user"
```

A successful response includes the `x-edgeoptimize-request-id` header, confirming that the request was routed through Edge Optimize:

```
< HTTP/2 200
< x-edgeoptimize-request-id: 50fce12d-0519-4fc6-af78-d928785c1b85
```

**2. Test human traffic (should NOT be affected)**

Simulate a regular human browser request:

```
curl -svo /dev/null https://www.example.com/page.html \
  --header "user-agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36"
```

The response should **not** contain the `x-edgeoptimize-request-id` header. The page content and response time should remain identical to before enabling Optimize at Edge.

**3. How to differentiate between the two scenarios**

| Header | Bot traffic (optimized) | Human traffic (unaffected) |
|---|---|---|
| `x-edgeoptimize-request-id` | Present — contains a unique request ID | Absent |
| `x-edgeoptimize-fo` | Present only if failover occurred (value: `1`) | Absent |

The status of the traffic routing can also be checked in the LLM Optimizer UI. Navigate to **Customer Configuration** and select the **CDN Configuration** tab.
