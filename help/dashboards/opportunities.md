# Optimization opportunities

Optimization opportunities are automatically detected insights that show where your site and external presence can be improved to increase brand visibility in AI search. These optimizations include on-page fixes (adding structured content, canonicals, or summaries), technical adjustments (unblocking AI crawlers or resolving errors) and influencing content on third-party authoritative sites. Addressing these optimization opportunities helps your brand be accurately represented and more likely to be cited in generative responses.

## Opportunities Dashboard

The optimization opportunities presented on the dashboard are prioritized based on player gaps, trending topics, and performance data and presented as a list. You can search for a specific opportunity by using the search field. Also, opportunities are grouped by tags, and you can click directly on a tag to show all the  opportunities grouped under that tag.

Clicking **Details** will open a separate window where more information and additional guidance is provided.

## Supported opportunities

Presented below is a table of currently supported opportunities:

| Opportunity | Type | Identified Issues | Fix Suggestions |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|
|Summarize Long Paragraphs | Content (Onsite) | Detects paragraphs exceeding recommended length thresholds. Shows affected URLs and oversized text snippets. | Create abstracts or split long text into shorter, scannable sections. |
| Recommend Structured Content (FAQs)| Content (Onsite) | Detects high-popularity prompts without matching FAQ entries. Shows related prompts, categories, and affected URLs. | Add FAQ schema blocks with concise answers to match common queries. |
| Detect Missing Hreflang | Content (Onsite)| Flags pages missing hreflang attributes. Provides affected URLs and expected coverage by language/region.| Implement hreflang tags to indicate correct localized versions. |
| Detect Missing Canonicals | Content (Onsite) | Scans for pages without canonical tags or with conflicting tags. Lists affected URLs and duplicates. | Add canonical tags pointing to the preferred version of each page. Ensure consistent usage across variants. |
| Detect Empty Headings | Content (Onsite) | Flags pages where heading tags exist but contain no text. Shows URL and location of empty tags. | Add descriptive text to headings that reflect the content beneath them. |
| Detect Duplicate Headings | Content (Onsite) | Scans HTML heading tags and flags repeated headings. Shows affected URLs and duplicated text snippets. | Revise headings to be unique and maintain hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3). Merge or rename duplicate sections. |
| Detect Blocked Agentic Traffic | Technical GEO | Analyzes CDN logs for blocked requests from known AI agents (e.g., GPTBot, PerplexityBot). Reports affected URLs and agents. | Update robots.txt or server configs to allow access for supported AI crawlers where appropriate. |
| Detect 404s / 403s / 5xx Issues | Technical GEO | Monitors CDN logs for error responses. Reports frequency, affected URLs, and estimated hits lost. | Fix broken links, update permissions, and resolve server-side issues so key content returns 200 responses. |

### Recover Content Visibility Opportunity {#recover-contet}

As stated above, the content visibility opportunity, flags pages where key content is lost for AI agents due to client-side rendering. For each identified page, it shows you exactly which content is missing from the AI agent view, helping you pinpoint visibility gaps. It's also supported by an edge-based pre-rendering capability that can serve more HTML content to agentic traffic without requiring Content Management System (CMS) changes. This functionality is currently in Early Access and requires setup from the LLMO team. Please contact [llmo-at-edge@adobe.com](llmo-at-edge@adobe.com) to activate the content visibility opportunity.

### Additional Tools

The [LLM visibility checker](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/is-your-webpage-citable/jbjngahjjdgonbeinjlepfamjdmdcbcc) is a Chrome extension that lets you see exactly how much of your webpage content LLMs can access and also what stays hidden. Designed as a free, standalone diagnostic tool, it requires no product license or setup. With a single-click, users can evaluate any site's machine-readability, view a side-by-side comparison of what AI agents see versus what human users see. Also, estimates how much content could be recovered by using LLM Optimizer.
