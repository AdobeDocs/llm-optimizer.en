# Overview

Optimization opportunities are automatically detected insights that show where your site and external presence can be improved to increase brand visibility in AI search. These include on-page fixes (like adding structured content, canonicals, or summaries), technical adjustments (like unblocking AI crawlers or resolving errors)and influencing content on third-party authoritative sites so your brand is accurately represented and more likely to be cited in generative responses.

## List of supported opportunities

At the top of the dashboard, you can refine your view by:

Opportunity | Type | Auto-Identify | Auto-Suggest
---------|----------|----------|----------|
 Summarize Long Paragraphs | Content (Onsite) | Detects paragraphs exceeding recommended length thresholds. Shows affected URLs and oversized text snippets. | Create abstracts or split long text into shorter, scannable sections. |
 Recommend Structured Content (FAQs)| Content (Onsite) | Detects high-popularity prompts without matching FAQ entries. Shows related prompts, categories, and affected URLs. | Add FAQ schema blocks with concise answers to match common queries. |
 Detect Missing Hreflang | Content (Onsite)| Flags pages missing hreflang attributes. Provides affected URLs and expected coverage by language/region.| Implement hreflang tags to indicate correct localized versions. |
 Detect Missing Canonicals | Content (Onsite) | Detects paragraphs exceeding recommended length thresholds. Shows affected URLs and oversized text snippets. | Create abstracts or split long text into shorter, scannable sections. |
 Detect Empty Headings | Content (Onsite) | Flags pages where heading tags exist but contain no text. Shows URL and location of empty tags. | Add descriptive text to headings that reflect the content beneath them. |
 Detect Duplicate Headings | Content (Onsite) | Scans HTML heading tags and flags repeated headings. Shows affected URLs and duplicated text snippets. | Revise headings to be unique and maintain hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3). Merge or rename duplicate sections. |
 Detect Blocked Agentic Traffic | Technical GEO | Analyzes CDN logs for blocked requests from known AI agents (e.g., GPTBot, PerplexityBot). Reports affected URLs and agents. | Update robots.txt or server configs to allow access for supported AI crawlers where appropriate. |
 Detect 404s / 403s / 5xx Issues | Technical GEO | Monitors CDN logs for error responses. Reports frequency, affected URLs, and estimated hits lost. | Fix broken links, update permissions, and resolve server-side issues so key content returns 200 responses. |
